__All of my projects take an inordinate amount of time to upkeep/create.  
I use my free time to make them. Any support would be much appreciated!  
If you enjoy these packs and want to see more like them and see them maintained, send me some love!__    

I created this on a whim after updating raijin to its proper form.

I hope you enjoy!
